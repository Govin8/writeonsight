WriteOnSight is a web-based application designed to simplify the conversion of text from images into editable, searchable content. Whether it’s handwritten notes, printed documents, or lecture slides, the platform uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to help users quickly and securely digitize text.

Aimed at students, professionals, and everyday users, WriteOnSight focuses on privacy, ease of use, and productivity. Users can upload images, extract text, and edit or export it into various formats. The platform also includes a built-in writing dashboard for note-taking and organizing drafts—all in one place. By bridging the gap between physical notes and digital workflows, WriteOnSight empowers users to work smarter, faster, and more creatively.
